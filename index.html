<p> In March 2018, I joined <a href="http://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> (formerly known as ICSL) in Seoul National University to pursue research in Robotics. My research interests are Distributed Robot System and Multi-Agent Trajectory Planning (MATP), in particular Collision Avoidance [<a href="/research/journal/RAL2022/">1</a>] and Deadlock Resolution [<a href="/research/conference/ICRA2023/">2</a>] in obstacle environments. </p>
