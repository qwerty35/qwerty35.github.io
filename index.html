<p> In March 2018, I joined <a href="http://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> (formerly known as ICSL) in Seoul National University to pursue research in Robotics. </p>
<p> My research interests are Distributed Robot System and Multi-Agent Trajectory Planning (MATP), in particular Collision Avoidance [<a href="/research/conference/Robust-Real-time-RGB-D-Visual-Odometry-in-Dynamic-Environments-via-Rigid-Motion-Model/">1</a>] and Deadlock Resolution [<a href="/research/conference/Realtime-Rigid-Motion-Segmentation-using-Grid-based-Optical-Flow/">2</a>] in obstacle environments. </p>
