**Abstract:** This letter presents a new distributed multi-agent trajectory planning algorithm that generates safe, dynamically feasible trajectories considering the uncertainty of obstacles in dynamic environments. We extend the relative safe flight corridor (RSFC) presented in previous work to replace time-variant, non-convex collision avoidance constraints to convex ones, and we adopt a relaxation method based on reciprocal collision avoidance (RCA) to reduce the total flight time and distance without loss of success rate. We validate the robustness of the proposed algorithm through a real flight test with four quadrotors and one moving human.
